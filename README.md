# MitralValveSegmentation - ETH Advanced Machine Learning 2023 Task 3
In this task, we first had to pre process the data by extracting all the frames from the videos which were annotated. Then we had to resize all images to the same size, we chose to shrink the bigger images. We then performed data augmentation by applying the elasticdeform.defrom_grid method. We randomly shift, rotate and zoom an image.  We performed the same of operations on our labels too of course. We also normalise the images. This allows us to have around 5000 training samples. We then split the training data in to train and validation sets and split those in to batches to train on. The model we used was a standard UNet implemented from scratch in pytorch with batch normalisation. We train the model using the negative of the jaccard similarity as the loss. For prediction, we also resize and normalise the test images. We post process the predictions of our model by applying the closing operation on it (dilation and erosion). We also threshold the predictions, only allowing values higher than 0.6 to be considered part of the mitral-valve instead of the usual 0.5. Finally we upscale the predictions back to the original size of the images.
